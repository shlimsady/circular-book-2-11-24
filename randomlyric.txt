slave
he who cannot choose
life is to hard 
to be understood
words and actions are meant
fear will be dispelled
all rules that aren't god's
and seeing is believing
and believing is timeless
ones that dont speak for themselves
mary helped me provoking me fear
traumatised by erratic
you think its spontaneous
people cultivate their own seeds
every novelty you think your life needs
i cracked the code
that part is true
thought cant tell me whats my intention
what do all things say about the soul
out of my system
challenge reality
attacks, dreams and trips
near death experience
the nature of god
open your heart and see
creativity proves
nothing else exists
the golden age
of the grotesque
the mind is a mirror
the spirit its substance
the cosmos has mechanical means
sadness is sweet
opposite phases cancel themselves
find your gift and give it away
acknowledge but not accept it or reject it
dealing with something else
what connects me to this place
the solitary book of just me and my thoughts
i want to share art
you should want to live for no reason
jesus was the first to find gods love
and so are you
cauaslity in mentaltiy dont exist
